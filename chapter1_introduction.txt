1.
AI systems need the ability to acquire their own knowledge, by extracting patterns from raw data. This capability is known asmachine learning

2.
 use machine learning to discover not onlythe mapping from representation to output but also the representation itself.This approach is known asrepresentation learning.

3. 
The quintessential example of a representation learning algorithm is theau-toencoder
